Changed format from ffmdata(pickled class) to json.
Need to make the serializer/deserializer cleaner (a la django)

Issues:
    -> one shots without reviews (e.g. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13357130/1/Earthling) need a lot of change for parsing. Will need to make the 
    parser cleaner


    -> Qt freezes on download obviously, because we're using a blocking module for download. Need to fix this (qt and asyncio)
