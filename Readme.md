**Update (2021-01-17)**: Cloudflare fix works as long as ffnet doesn't blacklist your IP. Changed format from pickle to json. Will add separate downloader/converter soon.

**Update (2021-01-14)**: Even with the cloudflare fix, this no longer 
works (challenge v2 error). I plan to soon add a separate downloader (if worst comes to worst, using selenium) and a separate converter (to PDF or epub)

**Warning**: Due to fanfiction.net having recently adopted Cloudflare, some changes have been made. 
If the program crashes unexpectedly, try downloading again
