**Update (2021-01-14)**: Even with the cloudflare fix, this no longer 
works (challenge v2 error). I plan to soon add a separate downloader (if worst comes to worst, using selenium) and a separate converter (to PDF or epub)

**Warning**: Due to fanfiction.net having recently adopted Cloudflare, some changes have been made. 
If the program crashes unexpectedly, try downloading again

Dependencies:
* Qt5
* html5lib 
* cloudscraper

### Current Capabilites:
* Downloading stories
* Basic Library
* Rudimentary Reading

## To add:
* Custom tagging and filtering [in-progress/half-done]
* Bulk downloads
